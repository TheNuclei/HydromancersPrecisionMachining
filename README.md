# HydromancersPrecisionMachining
A weapon retooling mod with a new skill tree for crafting mods.
This is a mod aimed at working within some of the in game RNG aimed at being balanced with the vanilla experience with a few improvements.

To install this mod simply drop it into the Mods folder of your 7dtd installation or the server's root directory. This is a server side only mod! Any users may connect without a copy and enjoy it.

Features:

New Workstation: Machining Bench - The Table Saw has been repurposed since it was dropped from the main game, it now serves as the Machining Bench from where you can create mods and re-tool your equipment.
- Mods must now be crafted from this bench
- This bench may be found in the wild on worlds where this mod was present when it was initialized

Retooling: Reroll your equipment stats!
- The ingredients are the equipment in question and a handful of the original crafting parts
- RETOOLED ITEMS MAY NOT BE SOLD TO THE TRADER. He has no idea what you've done to the thing, it might explode on him!
- The resulting item will have their stats re-randomized as though it were crafted fresh
- Lower quality weapons may be upgraded to your max craftable quality in this way. This is why you cannot sell them to the trader (to maintain vanilla-like balance).
- Only equipment that is made using 'parts' of some kind may be re-tooled. Otherwise there is nothing for you to tinker around with.

New Skill: Machinist
- A new crafting skill under the Intellect tree
- Unlocks a variety of useful but not overly broken mods for you to craft.
- All mods are of the iron tier, as no other skill unlocks steel recipes. Mods involving steel must be found in the wild or the recipes found as usual
- Improves the damage bonus of mods per level. Mods typically provide 10% damage up to the equipment. At level 5 the boost becomes 12.5% per mod (+25% of 10%)
- Unlocks the ability to craft the machinist bench

New Item: Machinist's Compendium
- Cheap useful book for worlds that have already been established. Updates your crafting recipes to include the new retooling recipes for items you have already learned how to craft prior to installing the mod. It's made with some paper, a glue, and a coal in the workbench.
